The original contributor had released the code under a commons licence. 
Therefore, use of this is in doubt until I get to know the licence and adjust the status of this product appropriately.

Largely unfinished. Major refactoring of the Header handling code and caches has been changed to suit better structures for parsing.

Have completely re written these to suit using original code. Also the parser is being ripped out and being replaced with newer NIO code making use of ByteBuffer's and in built reads.

By the time I am fisnished with this product it will be a full featured multi purpose PE parser.
